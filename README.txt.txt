Implementing a detector which can check if people are maintaining social distancing or not. We can check this by calculating the Euclidean distance between individuals detected in the video stream.

Language Used is Python
IDE used is Jupyter Notebook

This detector helps us to monitor people violating social distancing. Euclidean Distance is basically distance between two given points and these given points are represented by different forms of co-ordinates and can vary on dimensional space.
We first import the numpy library and then use the numpy module to find the Euclidean distance between the two points.
We used the math.dist() function to find the Euclidean Distance[dist.cdist()].

Step by Step explanation is given in the code file.
